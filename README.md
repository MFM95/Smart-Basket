# Smart-Basket
An Android app for school kids to keep their schools clean, it encourages them to put the rubbish in the baskets. 
pupils can get questions based on their IDs, ages and selected subjects,
and for the pupil to choose an answer from A, B, and C he throws a piece of paper in basket A, B or C .
The app is put in schools beside the 3 baskets and each basket is connected to a ship with Bluetooth sensor, 
when a piece of rubbish touches the chip inside the basket, a signal is sent to the app and the answer is submitted 
based on the number of the basket been touched.
Students, their scores, questions and answers are stored in a database.
